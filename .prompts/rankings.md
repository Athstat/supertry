**Cursor Prompt – Fantasy Rugby App Rankings Screen (Divisions System)**

---

**Design a Rankings screen for the app, structured around a 10-tier 'Divisions' system.**

### **Layout:**

1. **Top Section:**

   - Displays user’s **Current Division Badge** (Div 1–10)
   - Shows **Rank, Score, and Weekly Reset Timer**

2. **Middle Section (Leaderboard):**

   - **Scrollable list of 20 players** in the user’s Division
   - Each row includes: **Avatar, Rank, Name, Points, Up/Down Arrow for movement**
   - **Promotion Zone (Top 5 players, green indicator)**
   - **Demotion Zone (Bottom 5 players, red indicator)**

3. **Bottom Section:**
   - **Small text explaining promotion/demotion rules**
   - **Button: 'View Division History'** to track past ranks

### **Design Guidelines:**

- **Use colored indicators** (green for promotion, red for demotion)
- **Gold/Silver/Bronze styling for top 3 players**
- **Subtle animations** for rank changes
- **Minimalist, mobile-friendly layout**

The UI should be **engaging, competitive, and visually clean** while ensuring easy navigation.
