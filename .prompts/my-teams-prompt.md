**Objective:**  
Build a "MyTeam" screen for our fantasy sports app using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Requirements:**

- **Display:**
  - Show the selected team’s lineup with player names, positions, and individual points.
  - Display team total points and ranking.
- **Substitution:**
  - Allow users to select a player and view available substitutes.
  - Implement an intuitive substitution mechanism (e.g., modal or inline swap) with confirmation.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Use a minimal, clean design with Tailwind CSS.
  - Integrate visual feedback (ripple effects, smooth color transitions) and support dark/light themes.
- **Tech:**
  - Use React functional components with hooks.
  - Ensure full type safety with TypeScript.
  - Follow our existing project structure and coding conventions.

**Output:**  
A self-contained "MyTeam" screen component that displays the user’s selected team and allows player substitutions, delivering an MVP similar to popular fantasy sports apps like FPL.
